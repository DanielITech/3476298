# Assignment: Layouts 01



## Problem statement

Most Apps now feature logins before you can access all/some of the app's features.
We would like to design a Login View with only default controls and styling, with an image beautifully shown on the left, how should we go about it.

Take for instance the ```screenshot_01.jpg``` in the ```resources/images``` folder is what we are imagining, how do you convert this idea into a real UI.

## Procedures

* Both ```RowLayout```and ```ColumnLayout``` has been used
* Spacing has been achieved using both layout spacing property and ```Layout``` margins properties - be free to use, combine and apply them however you want
* Font that was used is Roboto Thin, please install it on your machine before using it in the UI.
* Default QtQuick controls was used without any customisations and styling

## Helpful Info
* Dimensions - 680 x 480
* font-family - Roboto Light
* font-pixelSize - 30
* color - dodgerblue
