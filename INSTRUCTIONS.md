# Assignment: Layouts 01



## Problem statement

Most Apps now feature login functionality before you can access all/some of the app's features.
We would like to design a Login View with only default controls and styling, with an image beautifully shown on the left. How should we go about it?

Take for instance, that the ```screenshot_01.jpg``` in the ```resources/images``` folder is what we are imagining. How do you convert that imagination into a real UI for the Application



## Procedure

* Fork the course's repo (https://github.com/DanielITech/3476298) on github.com unto your own GitHub account

* **Do Not** open the  `Assignment-Layouts-01-Solution` and the `Assignment-Layouts-01-Submission` branches yet. **Do not** look at the code there yet.

* **Create** your **own** solution branch, **name it** whatever you like and **base** it on either the `Assignment-Layouts-01-BaseSolution` or on  a cleaned up branch. Your final submission should be clean like the `Assignment-Layouts-01-Solution` branch.

* The `Assignment-Layouts-01-Problem` branch contains all the resources you will need for this assignment in the `resources` folder and an `INSTRUCTIONS.md` containing this same instructions as to how to go about the assignment.

* **Copy entirely** the `resources` folder from the `Assignment-Layouts-01-Problem` branch into your **newly created** solution branch and make your commits to that branch

* When you are done, compare your code in **your** solution branch to the `Assignment-Layouts-01-Solution` . See where you fall short, if you do not fall short in any way, you are ready to send it to me. Send it as a Pull Request.

* Make your Pull Request to the `Assignment-Layouts-01-Submission` branch.

* Your code will be reviewed from there.




## Guidelines

* Both ```RowLayout```and ```ColumnLayout``` has been used

* Spacing has been achieved using both layout spacing property and ```Layout``` margins properties - be free to use, combine and apply them however you want

* Font that was used is Roboto Thin, please install it on your machine before using it in the UI.

* Default QtQuick controls was used without any customisations and styling




## Helpful Info
